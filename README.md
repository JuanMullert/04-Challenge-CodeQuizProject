# 04-Challenge-CodeQuizProject

On this particular assignment you'll see a Coding Quiz I created with the help of HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript (which gave all the functionality and dinamics). This Quiz has basic questions
about the fundamentals of Web Development and you have to answer them with a click on one of the four
answer options.

You have 70 seconds to finish the quiz, if you answer incorrectly you'll get 10 seconds taken off from the timer.
